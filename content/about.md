## What I Do

### Design Director

I built and led Betterment’s first team of 4 designers. I also led design for two different business lines simultaneously, managing process and creative between stakeholders, and acquiring thousands of clients.

### Design System Lead

I pioneered what a shared design system means to Betterment – growing it from a simple color library to managing 200+ components and 30 contributors, most recently powering an entire rebrand project in 6 weeks.

### Product Designer

I led day-to-day product design on a cross-functional agile squad building product features – collaborating on planning, strategy, research, testing, design, and execution, as well as metrics and iteration.

### Software Engineer

I built features end-to-end across all Betterment applications, from front- end apps to internal tools. I managed all WordPress environments and contributed on code reviews, deployments, and infrastructure.

### Visual Designer

I designed compelling visuals to tell brand stories across marketing, advertising, and product channels. I have worked on print, web, branding, and e-commerce projects for business, education, and non-profit clients.

## What Drives Me
### Solving Problems

I'm curious, ambitious, and passionate. I'm all about diving in head first to a tough challenge, and learning everything I can to help me come up with a solution.

### Collaboration

I believe that people working together can change the world. I want to build teams where people can contribute and learn from each other with passion and respect.

### Missions That Matter

I want to work with people who have seen a real problem and are motivated to fix it. I know that technology can help build a better future for both a product's people and the world.

### Diversity

Diverse groups are more innovative and create a culture that is more productive and inclusive. I'm constantly working to build teams where different voices can build better products.

### Delight

People who are happy and having fun do better work. Users who enjoy their experience are loyal and have trust in the product. I love finding and creating those moments of joy.
