I’m a product design leader with over 15 years of experience in the design and tech world. I love to make users’ lives more delightful by breaking down and solving complex problems in simple ways.

#### I’m looking for an opportunity where I can help figure out what design and user experience means to an organization, its products, and its team.

I'm a designer, a problem solver, a collaborator, and a leader. Let's work together.
